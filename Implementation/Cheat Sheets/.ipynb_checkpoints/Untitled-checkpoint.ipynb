    "Cron is a tool that allows you to execute _something_ on a schedule. This is typically done using the cron syntax. We allow you to execute a function whenever your scheduled job triggers. We also allow you to execute a job external to the javascript process using `child_process`. Additionally, this library goes beyond the basic cron syntax and allows you to supply a Date object. This will be used as the trigger for your callback. Cron syntax is still an acceptable CronTime format. Although the Cron patterns supported here extend on the standard Unix format to support seconds digits, leaving it off will default to 0 and match the Unix behavior."

    "* Millisecond level granularity in JS or moment date objects. Because computers take time to do things, there may be some delay in execution. This should be on the order of milliseconds. This module doesn't allow MS level granularity for the regular cron syntax, but _does_ allow you to specify a real date of execution in either a javascript date object or a moment object. When this happens you may find that you aren't able to execute a job that _should_ run in the future like with `new Date().setMilliseconds(new Date().getMilliseconds() + 1)`. This is due to those cycles of execution above. This wont be the same for everyone because of compute speed. When I tried it locally I saw that somewhere around the 4-5 ms mark was where I got consistent ticks using real dates, but anything less than that would result in an exception. This could be really confusing. We could restrict the granularity for all dates to seconds, but felt that it wasn't a huge problem so long as you were made aware. If this becomes more of an issue, We can revisit it.\n",
